1. If you only pickup small data for one time. use parser.
2. If you need to use many or frequently, use Binding

/*
3 ways to parser JSON data
  (1). use GSON binding(fromJson()). Need to create a Data Class
  (2). use com.googlecode.json-simple. This is same as DOM. Not good for deep JSON
  (3). use com.jayway.jsonpath, like XPATH. but it seems array only works less than3. 
  (4). ObjectMapperBinding
  Suggest: Use GSON binding
